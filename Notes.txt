When we want to render full page component we have to use the layout file.

php artisan livewire:layout => to create the layout file by default it will create the folder component and layout file named app.blade.php inside it. you can change it from config file.

php artisan make:livewire Examples.ShowUser --inline => will create the single php file not the blade file.
php artisan make:livewire Examples.ShowUser => will create two files one in resources folder and other is in app folder. 
above command is used for component creation.

inline components are having html code inside the php file.

php artisan livewire:stubs => used for creating custom components
This will create four new files in your application:

stubs/livewire.stub — used for generating new components
stubs/livewire.inline.stub — used for generating inline components
stubs/livewire.test.stub — used for generating test files
stubs/livewire.view.stub — used for generating component views

you can modify them. after modifing you can run normal component creation commands and modification will be reflected in your components.

for injecting the livewire component inside other component or in blade file you have mentioned the its proper location if it is not inside the component or livewire folder. i.e <livewire:examples.create-user />

We can pass data to view from php class of livewire with the with() function.
